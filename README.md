Open source reimplementation of Game Boy Color using all new components

This PCB is designed to be a complete ground-up reimplementation of the Game Boy Color. I made it because I had a knockoff GBC clone, but the overall quality was quite bad, and it could use many improvements.

This PCB is designed to fit inside a standard Game Boy Color shell.



To build this project, you'll need everything in the BOM below, as well as this PCB by ReverseRetroLib. https://github.com/jbshelton/ReverseRetroLib/tree/main/Gameboy/Cartridge%20adapter

You'll also need a GBC power board, the Simple Gameboy Regulator is recommended. The BOM for this is included below as well. https://github.com/Jackv-makes/SGR
